# PQC
We propose an implementation of ROLLO-I that is a second round candidate to NIST PQC standardization. 
A Makefile is present in each folder ROLLOI_X with X=128,192,256 corresponding to the source code of the three different levels of security.
To execute the code:
Use the commande $ make to compile followed by the command $ ./rollo to run the code.
